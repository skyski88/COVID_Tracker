Tracking COVID-19 

As we are 6+ months into the COVID-19 pandemic, cases continue to rise across the United States.  We want users to be able to find current, up-to-date COVID-19 data. This site allows users to search for the state they reside in and search for other state data as well. It provides the user with current cases, recovered cases and death rates. You will also be able to see the current data for the entire United States as well. If the user wanted to learn more about COVID-19, they can browse through educational COVID-19 videos and read through safety guidelines which provide additional information on keeping everyone safe during this pandemic.
